# **Objectives and requirements**</br>*On-Premises Installation and Deployment*

## **i. About this lab**

The **On-Premises Installation and Deployment** module provides comprehensive instructions for how to prepare, configure, and deploy a simulated on-premises cluster for *IBM watsonx Code Assistant* (WCA) on environments hosted by *IBM Technology Zone* (ITZ).

By completing this module, participants will have learned and applied the skills necessary for deploying WCA on a client's on-premises infrastructure. The complete stack of technologies and services that you will deploy include:

- <a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.18" target="_blank">**Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform v4.18**</a>: a unified application development platform that lets clients build, modernize, and deploy applications at scale on their choice of hybrid cloud infrastructure.

- <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cloud-paks/cp-data/5.1.x" target="_blank">**IBM Cloud Pak for Data v5.1.x**</a>: a set of services comprising a data fabric solution for data governance, data engineering, data analysis, and AI lifecycle tasks.

- <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.1.x" target="_blank">**IBM Software Hub v5.1**</a>: a cloud-native solution that clients use to install, manage, and monitor IBM solutions on Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

- <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/wx-code-assistant/5.1.x" target="_blank">**IBM watsonx Code Assistant v5.1**</a>: a generative AI coding companion that provides contextually aware assistance for programming languages.

Special acknowledgement and thanks to IBM colleagues Coralie Jonvel, Nelson Nunes, and Noe Samaille for adaptation of their <a href="https://github.ibm.com/CESC-Infrastructure-Services/Installation-CP4D-WatsonX" target="_blank">**deployment instructions**</a> for watsonx.ai on Red Hat OpenShift.

!!! warning "GPUs NOT SUPPORTED FOR L4 ON-PREMISES DEPLOYMENTS"
    Resource and budget constraints for IBM Technology Zone and the IBM Enablement teams means that GPUs are **unavailable for the on-premises portion** of the Level 4 curriculum.
    
    The NVIDIA A100 or H100 GPUs required are simply too cost-prohibitive to be made available for individual IBMers and business partners. GPUs cannot be shared in a multi-tenant access pattern for IBM watsonx Code Assistant â€” and, as such, at minimum two cards would need to be made available for every L4 reservation. These costs are beyond the scope of what can be supported by this training.

    Participants ***will* have access to GPUs for the IBM Cloud (SaaS) portion** of the Level 4 curriculum.

## **ii. Infrastructure and resource requirements**

!!! note ""
    Requirements specific to the hands-on environment are outlined in the section below. Comprehensive details about the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.1.x?topic=requirements-x86-64-hardware#services" target="_blank">**hardware requirements for x86_64 cluster services**</a> are available from IBM Software Hub documentation.
    
Although the hands-on environment that will be provisioned in this module utilizes a templated, pre-defined ITZ infrastructure configuration, it will be useful for those enrolled to understand the resources required to reproduce a similar cluster in real-world client scenarios. This includes details about the CPU, memory, GPU, and other hardware components required to support the necessary cluster services.
