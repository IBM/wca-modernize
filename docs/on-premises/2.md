# **Reserve an environment**</br>*On-Premises Installation and Deployment*

## **i. Configuring the IBM Technology Zone reservation**

The foundation for the on-premises environment utilizes the `OpenShift Cluster (VMware on IBM Cloud) - UPI - Public` template from the collection of <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/collection/tech-zone-certified-base-images/journey-vmware-on-ibm-cloud-environments" target="_blank">**IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) Certified Base Images**</a>.

3. Supply additional details about the ITZ reservation request:

    !!! note "RESERVATON POLICY NOTICE"
        After selecting `Education` for the *Purpose* field, you may receive a pop-up notification stating that `this environment is now being redirected to the OCP base image hosted On-Prem for Education and Test`. You can safely **ignore** this notice and close it by clicking the *X* in the top-right corner.
        
        **Do not** configure using the Poughkeepsie-based resource that the notice attempts to redirect you to â€” it will not allow you to configure the necessary hardware specifications. Continue with the ITZ reservation request form as detailed below. If the pop-up appears again later in the configuration steps, continue to disregard the notice.

    | Field | Value |
    | - | - |
    | **Name** | Give the reservation a unique name. |
    | **Purpose** | `Education` |
    | **Purpose Description** | Give the reservation a unique description. |
    | **Preferred Geography** | Select the region and data center geographically closest to your location. |
    | **End Date and Time** | Select a time and date for when the reservation will expire. |
    | **OpenShift Version** | `4.16` |
    | **Worker Node Count** | `3` |
    | **Worker Node Flavor** | `32 vCPU x 128 GB - 300 GB ephemeral storage` |
    | **Storage** | `ODF - 2 TB` |
    | **OCP/Kubernetes Cluster Network** | `10.128.0.0/14` |
    | **OCP/Kubernetes Service Network** | `172.30.0.0/16` |
    | **Enable nested hardware virtualization on workers** | `No` |

4. When satisfied, verify that you agree to the *Terms and Conditions* for the environment and finalize your reservation request by clicking **Submit**.

    Navigate to the **<a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations" target="_blank">My Reservations</a>** tab of the ITZ to monitor the progress of your reservation. While *"Provisioning"*^[A]^, the reservation will be marked with a yellow tile. **Wait** for the ITZ reservation to be marked as *"Ready"*^[B]^before continuing.

    !!! warning "PROVISIONING TIMES"
        This operation will take approximately **90 - 120 minutes** to complete.
