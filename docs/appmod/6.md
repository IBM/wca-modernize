# **Java Message Service integration**</br>*Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty*
    
## **i. Incentives to modernize**

!!! quote "SECTION I. TERMINOLOGY"
    For readability, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-application-server" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Application Server**</a> (WAS) in this chapter is referred to in shorthand as "WebSphere", unless noted otherwise. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-applications/liberty" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Liberty**</a> is referenced in shorthand as simply "Liberty".

**WebSphere** traditionally connects Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) applications to **IBM MQ** using complex **Java Message Service** (**JMS**) configurations which depend upon external XML files. JMS is the standard by which Java APIs send, receive, and manage asynchronous messages between distributed Java EE applications. In turn, IBM MQ provides a middleware layer to ensure that such asynchronous messaging are delivered *reliably* between said applications. Collectively, these components come together to form the **WebSphere MQ JMS integration** that Lariat Corporation is using in their legacy systems today.

**Liberty** still makes use of JMS and MQ, but replaces the use of external XML file configuration management in favor of declarative configurations *directly within* Liberty's `server.xml` resource. The result is that configuration is no longer defined external to the server, which in turn reduces the complexity of managing such configurations for Lariat's developers and improves the maintainability of their messaging integrations.

</br>

| Feature | WebSphere MQ JMS Integration | Liberty JMS Configuration |
| - | - | - |
| **Complexity** | High complexity owing to verbose XML or admin console requirements. | Significantly simplified and concise. |
| **Maintainability** | Difficult, configuration is dispersed and complex. | Easy to maintain, with all resources clearly defined in one place. |
| **Productivity** | Lower developer productivity due to manual configuration and overhead. | Improved developer productivity due to straightforward and rapid setup. |
| **Integrations** | Cloud and microservices are harder to scale or adapt. | Cloud and microservices are easily adapted due to cloud-native design. |

By modernizing Lariat's WebSphere-based approach of MQ JMS integration to Liberty's declarative JMS-based configuration, the expectation is that the company's management of asynchronous message delivery between applications can be more easily maintained and better aligned to cloud-native best practices.

## **ii. WebSphere legacy code**

First, examine the legacy code (below), which as mentioned previously is a snapshot of a larger application using **WebSphere's MQ JMS integration**:

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1"
    <!-- ejb-jar.xml -->
    <message-driven>
        <ejb-name>LegacyMDB</ejb-name>
        <ejb-class>com.lariat.messaging.LegacyMDB</ejb-class>
        <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>
        <message-driven-destination>
            <destination-type>javax.jms.Queue</destination-type>
        </message-driven-destination>
    </message-driven>

    <!-- ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml -->
    <message-driven name="LegacyMDB">
        <activation-config>
            <activation-config-property>
                <activation-config-property-name>destination</activation-config-property-name>
                <activation-config-property-value>jms/legacyQueue</activation-config-property-value>
            </activation-config-property>
        </activation-config>
    </message-driven>
    ```

Lariat's particular implementation of WebSphere MQ JMS utilizes XML descriptors (`ejb-jar.xml`, `ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml` on **lines 1 and 11**, respectively) to define message-driven beans (MDB) and their JMS destinations.

This is the *explicit* and *manual* style of configuring messaging endpoints through separate descriptor (XML) files â€” in sharp contrast to the declarative approach you will examine with Liberty momentarily. WebSphere's approach of using separate descriptor files makes the setup of new configurations potentially more complex and prone to human-induced errors within the code.

---

## **iii. Liberty modernized code**

Consider below the modernized (but functionally equivalent) application code using **Liberty's JMS configuration**:

=== "WEBSPHERE LIBERTY"

    ``` xml linenums="1"
    <!-- server.xml -->
    <server>
        <featureManager>
            <feature>jms-2.0</feature>
        </featureManager>

        <jmsQueue id="modernQueue" jndiName="jms/modernQueue" />

        <messageDrivenBean id="ModernMDB">
            <activationSpec>
                <activationSpecClass>javax.jms.Queue</activationSpecClass>
                <activationSpecProperty name="destination">jms/modernQueue</activationSpecProperty>
            </activationSpec>
            <className>com.lariat.messaging.ModernMDB</className>
        </messageDrivenBean>
    </server>
    ```

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1"
    <!-- ejb-jar.xml -->
    <message-driven>
        <ejb-name>LegacyMDB</ejb-name>
        <ejb-class>com.lariat.messaging.LegacyMDB</ejb-class>
        <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>
        <message-driven-destination>
            <destination-type>javax.jms.Queue</destination-type>
        </message-driven-destination>
    </message-driven>

    <!-- ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml -->
    <message-driven name="LegacyMDB">
        <activation-config>
            <activation-config-property>
                <activation-config-property-name>destination</activation-config-property-name>
                <activation-config-property-value>jms/legacyQueue</activation-config-property-value>
            </activation-config-property>
        </activation-config>
    </message-driven>
    ```

Through the process of modernizing the code, Lariat switched to Liberty's messaging providers using standardized JMS APIs in a single, unified `server.xml` configuration. All JMS resources, such as queues and MDBs, are defined directly within the `server.xml` configuration file.

The net result is that configurations are simplified compared to the traditional WebSphere approach of separate descriptor files. Clearly named and easily identifiable JMS queues (**line 1**), as well as activation specifications (beginning on **line 3**), are consolidated within the streamlined `server.xml` configuration.

In summary, consolidation of Lariat's messaging configurations into a simplified and centralized pattern has streamlined future maintenance of these configuration files and simplified the process of troubleshooting messaging integrations for their developers.

## **iv. Hands-on with WCA**

!!! quote "SECTION IV. TERMINOLOGY"
    For the purposes of comparison and brevity, the WCA-generated Liberty code will be referred to simply as "**WCA**" and Lariat Corporation's best-practice modernized code will be referred to as "**Lariat**".

In the following section, participants will have the opportunity to experiment with the **watsonx Code Assistant** (**WCA**) service set up in the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/1/" target="_blank">**IBM Cloud (SaaS) Configuration module**</a>.

- Using the **Chat** feature, which can be accessed via the WCA extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will first ask WCA convert the original *WebSphere Application Service (WCA)* code into a modernized equivalent for *WebSphere Liberty*.
- The lab guide documentation will then walk you through an analysis of the WCA-generated Liberty code and compare that to the best-practice Liberty code discussed previously in **iii. Liberty modernized code**.
- After comparing the two approaches to Liberty modernization, you will have the opportunity to continue tinkering with the WCA Chat service. Experimentation is encouraged. Try influencing WCA's generative AI recommendations by making further prompts or inquiries into the code responses it generates.

When satisfied, you may proceed onwards to the next module.

---

1. **Log in** to the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/3/#iii-install-the-extension" target="_blank">**WCA extension with VS Code**</a>. Once authenticated, proceed to Step 2.

---

2. From the left taskbar, ensure that **watsonx Code Assistant**^[A]^ extension is selected.

    Within the **Chat Session** window, **click** on the `Enter / for commands` prompt^[B]^ as shown.

    </br>
    ![](_attachments/appmod-2.2.png)

---

3. Prime the service to be ready to intake legacy WAS code and modernize that into Liberty code. As a suggestion, **copy** the following prompt, **paste** it into the chat window, and hit ++return++ to execute the modernization request:

    ```
    I need to modernize code written for WebSphere Application Server into WebSphere Liberty. Can you help?
    ```
    !!! warning ""
        **TIP:** You can increase the width of the Chat Session window by clicking and dragging the right-side of the window frame and pulling it towards the right of the screen.

---

4. Now that WCA is primed to receive WAS code, **copy and paste** the following code block into the **Chat Session**, then ++return++ to execute.

    === "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

        ``` xml linenums="1"
        <!-- ejb-jar.xml -->
        <message-driven>
            <ejb-name>LegacyMDB</ejb-name>
            <ejb-class>com.lariat.messaging.LegacyMDB</ejb-class>
            <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>
            <message-driven-destination>
                <destination-type>javax.jms.Queue</destination-type>
            </message-driven-destination>
        </message-driven>

        <!-- ibm-ejb-jar-bnd.xml -->
        <message-driven name="LegacyMDB">
            <activation-config>
                <activation-config-property>
                    <activation-config-property-name>destination</activation-config-property-name>
                    <activation-config-property-value>jms/legacyQueue</activation-config-property-value>
                </activation-config-property>
            </activation-config>
        </message-driven>
        ```

---

5. After a few moments, WCA will return a combination of code blocks and explanations to the Chat session console. Cycle through the tab(s) below to examine the **modernized, WCA-generated Liberty code**.

    === "WCA LIBERTY `ejb-jar.xml` Part 1"

        ``` xml linenums="1"
        <ejb-jar xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/ejb-jar_3_1.xsd"
        version="3.1">

            <enterprise-beans>
                <message-driven>
                    <ejb-name>LegacyMDB</ejb-name>
                    <ejb-class>com.lariat.messaging.LegacyMDB</ejb-class>
                    <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>
                    <message-driven-destination>
                        <destination-type>javax.jms.Queue</destination-type>
                        <destination-jndi-name>jms/legacyQueue</destination-jndi-name>
                    </message-driven-destination>
                </message-driven>
            </enterprise-beans>
        </ejb-jar>
        ```

    === "WCA LIBERTY `ejb-jar.xml` Part 2"

        ``` java linenums="1"
        import javax.annotation.Resource;
        import javax.jms.JMSException;
        import javax.jms.Message;
        import javax.jms.MessageListener;
        import javax.jms.Queue;
        import javax.jms.QueueConnection;
        import javax.jms.QueueReceiver;
        import javax.jms.QueueSender;
        import javax.jms.Session;
        import javax.naming.InitialContext;
        import javax.naming.NamingException;

        @MessageDriven(
            name = "LegacyMDB",
            activationConfig = {
                @ActivationConfigProperty(propertyName = "destination", propertyValue = "jms/legacyQueue")
            }
        )

        public class LegacyMDB implements MessageListener {
            @Resource(name = "jms/legacyQueue")
            private Queue queue;

            @Resource(name = "jms/JmsConnectionFactory")
            private QueueConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

            @Resource(name = "jms/JmsXA")
            private InitialContext initialContext;

            public void onMessage(Message message) {
                // Your message processing logic here
            }

            // Other methods for sending messages, if needed
        }
        ```

---

6. **Explicit transaction control** is vital for systems that rely heavily on transactional integrity (such as banking, healthcare, order processing, and so on), so let's compare how Lariat and WCA's modernization efforts performed in this regard.

    </br>
    ``` java
    @Resource(name = "jms/JmsConnectionFactory")
    private QueueConnectionFactory connectionFactory;

    @Resource(name = "jms/JmsXA")
    private InitialContext initialContext;
    ```

    </br>
    By injecting a `QueueConnectionFactory` and `InitialContext`, WCA allows developers to exact a high degree of control over the JMS lifecycle. For real-world enterprise operations, redundancy and explicit design can provide safety for production environments (as well as protection against misdeployments.)

---

7. For many enterprises with **continuous integration and continuous delivery** (**CI/CD**) requirements, a Liberty codebase that uses an "`application code` + `server.xml`" approach may hamper those CI/CD pipelines. This is also true for enterprise organizations that might use runtime orchestration tools to override configurations with deployment descriptors. Let's compare the two solutions against this scenario.

    </br>
    ``` xml
    <ejb-jar xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/ejb-jar_3_1.xsd"
    version="3.1">
    ```

    </br>
    WCA's invocation of `ejb-jar.xml` enables declarative binding for legacy JMS destinations, providing a degree of backwards compatibility to other legacy applications in the company's estate that isn't as easily achieved with Lariat's code.

## **v. Next steps**

In the following module, participants will examine how to modernize legacy WebSphere Application Server code for security management.
