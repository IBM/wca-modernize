# **Basic migration capabilities**</br>*Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty*

## **i. Incentives to modernize**

!!! quote "SECTION I. TERMINOLOGY"
    For readability, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-application-server" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Application Server**</a> (WAS) in this chapter is referred to in shorthand as "WebSphere", unless noted otherwise. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-applications/liberty" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Liberty**</a> is referenced in shorthand as simply "Liberty".

Lariat Corporation has a large collection of **WebSphere Enterprise Archive** (EAR) applications designed specifically for deployments using **WAS**. These are packaged archive files that bundle together multiple Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE shorthand, or more recently referred to by Jakarta EE) components: web modules, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) files, resource adapters, libraries, and so on. Collectively, all of these components allow for Lariat's engineers and developers to manage complex enterprise applications "efficiently" (as the theory goes) by encapsulating all of the necessary components into a single, structured archive. 

**Liberty**, however, supports comparatively simple and standardized configurations that greatly reduce the complexities found with WebSphere applications. **Liberty Web Archive** (**WAR**) configurations remove the need for multiple external descriptors and consolidate settings into one unified file (`server.xml`). Overall, this approach improves the maintainability of the code base in the long term and improves the deployment speed for new instances (or versions) of the Liberty-based application.

</br>

| Feature | WebSphere EAR configuration | Liberty WAR configuration |
| - | - | - |
| **Deployment Complexity** | High: multiple modules and files to manage. | Low: single deployable artifact. |
| **Speed** | Slow deployments due to heightened complexity. | Faster deployments owing to simplicity and lightweight design. |
| **Maintainability** | Challenging due multiple configuration files need to managed and changes reconciled across multiple locations. | Streamlined and less complex. |
| **Scalability** | Difficult to scale due to potential for complex sets of dependencies. | Rapidly scaled due to cloud-native design. |

As part of the modernization efforts, the new Liberty application will need to support the functionality of the legacy WebSphere application, such as:

- Deployment of complex, modular Java EE applications onto WebSphere servers
- Encapsulation of web applications, EJB modules, and dependencies in a structured format
- Facilitate version control, deployment, and existing rollback strategies to guarantee consistent and reliable production environments

In general, the team supporting the modernization anticipate that Liberty will enable greatly simplified, more modular deployment structures — which in turn will reduce the overhead, complexity, and maintenance burden of these applications.

## **ii. WebSphere legacy code**

First, examine the legacy code (below), which as mentioned previously is a snapshot of a larger application using **WebSphere EAR configuration**:

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1"
    <!-- application.xml -->
    <application>
        <module>
            <web>
                <web-uri>legacyapp.war</web-uri>
                <context-root>/legacyapp</context-root>
            </web>
        </module>
        <module>
            <ejb>legacyEJB.jar</ejb>
        </module>
        <security-role>
            <role-name>user</role-name>
        </security-role>
    </application>

    <!-- ibm-web-bnd.xml -->
    <web-bnd>
        <virtual-host name="default_host" />
        <resource-ref name="jdbc/LegacyDS" binding-name="jdbc/LegacyDS" />
    </web-bnd>
    ```

</br>
The application defines two modules— `legacyapp.war` and `legacyEJB.jar` —which denote the web and EJB components of the application, respectively (**lines 5 and 10**).

- The code sets a specific context root to access the `legacyapp.war` web module.
- It also introduces WebSphere-specific bindings such as `ibm-web-bnd.xml` (**line 17**), which are employed for virtual hosting and resource references.
- Security roles and resource bindings are managed externally through the use of XML.

The legacy code showcased above has a particular structural element that makes it a prime candidate for this type of Liberty modernization. Chiefly, the EAR application uses *separate* XML descriptors like `application.xml` (**line 1**) and `ibm-web-bnd.xml` (**line 17**) to define distinct modules. This setup, at enterprise scale, becomes cumbersome to maintain and can often result in frequent deployment delays (or human-induced configuration errors) each time the modules need to be modified.

The maintenance burden of this more intricate structural design can be reduced with a more simplified, Liberty-based approach.

## **iii. Liberty modernized code**

Consider the modernized (functionally equivalent) code using **Liberty WAR configuration**:

=== "WEBSPHERE LIBERTY"

    ``` xml linenums="1" hl_lines="1"
    <!-- server.xml -->
    <server>
        <featureManager>
            <feature>webProfile-8.0</feature>
            <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
        </featureManager>

        <httpEndpoint host="*" httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443" />

        <application id="modernapp" location="modernapp.war" context-root="/modernapp">
            <classloader delegation="parentLast" />
        </application>

        <dataSource id="jdbc/ModernDS" jndiName="jdbc/ModernDS">
            <jdbcDriver libraryRef="jdbcLib" />
            <connectionManager maxPoolSize="50" />
        </dataSource>

        <library id="jdbcLib">
            <fileset dir="${server.config.dir}/jdbc" includes="*.jar" />
        </library>
    </server>
    ```

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1" hl_lines="1 17"
    <!-- application.xml -->
    <application>
        <module>
            <web>
                <web-uri>legacyapp.war</web-uri>
                <context-root>/legacyapp</context-root>
            </web>
        </module>
        <module>
            <ejb>legacyEJB.jar</ejb>
        </module>
        <security-role>
            <role-name>user</role-name>
        </security-role>
    </application>

    <!-- ibm-web-bnd.xml -->
    <web-bnd>
        <virtual-host name="default_host" />
        <resource-ref name="jdbc/LegacyDS" binding-name="jdbc/LegacyDS" />
    </web-bnd>
    ```
!!! note "BREVITY: DISPELLING MODERNIZATION MISCONCEPTIONS"
    The Liberty application code snippet is in fact "longer", in terms of lines of code, than the legacy WAS predecessor application. This raises an important point about modernized application code: *the brevity and terseness of an application's code does not always reflect more efficient or practical code.*
    
    What is important to the success and value of modernization efforts is that the new code is more appropriate to the tasks to be performed, has greater efficacy than before, and is more easily maintained — or a combination of these factors. Whether that is achieved in fewer lines of code than before is ultimately far less important.

</br>
The modernized Liberty application code streamlines the original WebSphere configuration details into a *single* WAR file (`server.xml`) with clear, unified definitions.

- JDBC configurations are directly defined alongside the application deployment, removing the need for external bindings.
    1. Legacy EAR files have been consolidated into lightweight Web Archive (WAR) structures.
    2. WebSphere-specific descriptors like `ibm-web-bnd.xml` have been converted into modern Liberty features (`webProfile-8.0`, `jdbc-4.2`).</br>

- WebSphere-specific APIs and deprecated components, like *AdminClient APIs* or *Java Naming and Directory Interface (JDNI)* look-ups, have been replaced.

- Liberty WAR configuration file uses `parentLast` (**line 11**) class loading to ensure that the application's resources take precedence.

    ``` xml
    <application id="modernapp" location="modernapp.war" context-root="/modernapp">
        <classloader delegation="parentLast" />
    </application>
    ```

</br>
Ultimately, the modernized Liberty application code supports Lariat's objectives of simplified, modular deployment structures that reduce the overhead and technical burdens placed on developers maintaining the legacy WebSphere code base.

## **iv. Hands-on with WCA**

!!! quote "SECTION IV. TERMINOLOGY"
    For the purposes of comparison and brevity, the WCA-generated Liberty code will be referred to simply as "**WCA**" and Lariat Corporation's best-practice modernized code will be referred to as "**Lariat**".

In the following section, participants will have the opportunity to experiment with the **watsonx Code Assistant** (**WCA**) service set up in the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/1/" target="_blank">**IBM Cloud (SaaS) Configuration module**</a>.

- Using the **Chat** feature, which can be accessed via the WCA extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will first ask WCA convert the original *WebSphere Application Service (WCA)* code into a modernized equivalent for *WebSphere Liberty*.
- The lab guide documentation will then walk you through an analysis of the WCA-generated Liberty code and compare that to the best-practice Liberty code discussed previously in **iii. Liberty modernized code**.
- After comparing the two approaches to Liberty modernization, you will have the opportunity to continue tinkering with the WCA Chat service. Experimentation is encouraged. Try influencing WCA's generative AI recommendations by making further prompts or inquiries into the code responses it generates.

When satisfied, you may proceed onwards to the next module.

---

1. **Log in** to the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/3/#iii-install-the-extension" target="_blank">**WCA extension with VS Code**</a>. Once authenticated, proceed to Step 2.

---

2. From the left taskbar, ensure that **watsonx Code Assistant**^[A]^ extension is selected.

    Within the **Chat Session** window, **click** on the `Enter / for commands` prompt^[B]^ as shown.

    </br>
    ![](_attachments/appmod-2.2.png)

---

3. Prime the service to be ready to intake legacy WAS code and modernize that into Liberty code. As a suggestion, **copy** the following prompt, **paste** it into the chat window, and hit ++return++ to execute the modernization request:

    ```
    I need to modernize code written for WebSphere Application Server into WebSphere Liberty. Can you help?
    ```
    !!! warning ""
        **TIP:** You can increase the width of the Chat Session window by clicking and dragging the right-side of the window frame and pulling it towards the right of the screen.

---

4. Now that WCA is primed to receive WAS code, **copy and paste** the following code block into the **Chat Session**, then ++return++ to execute.

    === "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

        ``` xml linenums="1"
        <!-- application.xml -->
        <application>
            <module>
                <web>
                    <web-uri>legacyapp.war</web-uri>
                    <context-root>/legacyapp</context-root>
                </web>
            </module>
            <module>
                <ejb>legacyEJB.jar</ejb>
            </module>
            <security-role>
                <role-name>user</role-name>
            </security-role>
        </application>

        <!-- ibm-web-bnd.xml -->
        <web-bnd>
            <virtual-host name="default_host" />
            <resource-ref name="jdbc/LegacyDS" binding-name="jdbc/LegacyDS" />
        </web-bnd>
        ```

---

5. After a few moments, WCA will return a combination of code blocks and explanations to the Chat session console. Cycle through the tab(s) below to examine the **modernized, WCA-generated Liberty code**.

    === "WCA LIBERTY `server.xml`"

        ``` xml linenums="1"
        <server description="new server">
        <featureManager>
            <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
            <feature>servlet-3.1</feature>
            <feature>ejbLite-3.2</feature>
        </featureManager>
        <httpEndpoint id="defaultHttpEndpoint" host="*" httpPort="9080" httpsPort="9443"/>
        <webApplication location="path/to/legacyapp.war" name="legacyapp">
            <context-root>/legacyapp</context-root>
            <classLoader commonLibraryRef="LibertyBasicCL"/>
        </webApplication>
        <basicRegistry id="LibertyBasicCL" realm="LibertyBasicRealm">
            <user name="admin" password="adminPassword" />
        </basicRegistry>
        <login-config>
            <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
        </login-config>
        <realm name="LibertyBasicRealm" realm-name="LibertyBasicRealm">
            <users file="path/to/users.properties"/>
            <groups file="path/to/groups.properties"/>
        </realm>
        <jdbcDriver libraryRef="DefaultDataSource"/>
        <dataSource jndiName="jdbc/LegacyDS" id="DefaultDataSource">
            <jdbcDriver libraryRef="XADatabase"/>
            <properties.db2.jcc databaseName="yourDatabaseName" serverName="yourServerName" portNumber="yourPortNumber"/>
        </dataSource>
        </server>
        ```

    === "WCA LIBERTY `web.xml`"

        ``` xml linenums="1"
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <web-app xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_1.xsd"
        version="3.1">

        <resource-ref>
            <description>Legacy Data Source</description>
            <res-ref-name>jdbc/LegacyDS</res-ref-name>
            <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>
            <res-auth>Container</res-auth>
        </resource-ref>

        <security-role>
            <role-name>user</role-name>
        </security-role>

        </web-app>
        ```

---

6. Let's first examine the use of **WebSphere and Liberty-specific features**. Lariat makes use of the `webProfile-8.0` bundle set for servlets and Enterprise JavaBeans:

    </br>

    ``` xml
    <featureManager>
        <feature>webProfile-8.0</feature>
        <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ```

    </br>
    By contrast, WCA has explicitly pulled in individual features like `jsp-2.3`, `servlet-3.1`, and `ejbLite-3.2` which provides finer control over imports - avoiding unnecessary bloat.

    </br>
    ``` xml
    <featureManager>
        <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
        <feature>servlet-3.1</feature>
        <feature>ejbLite-3.2</feature>
    </featureManager>
    ```

---

7. **Security configuration** is another area in which WCA has outperformed Lariat's modernization efforts. For Lariat, no authentication or user realm is configured. By contrast, WCA implements BASIC authentication, user and group registries, login, and custom realm with external property files. Security best-practices have been tuned and baked directly into the AI-generated code recommendations produced by WCA.

    ``` xml
    <basicRegistry id="LibertyBasicCL" realm="LibertyBasicRealm">
        <user name="admin" password="adminPassword" />
    </basicRegistry>
    <login-config>
        <auth-method>BASIC</auth-method>
    </login-config>
    <realm name="LibertyBasicRealm" realm-name="LibertyBasicRealm">
        <users file="path/to/users.properties"/>
        <groups file="path/to/groups.properties"/>
    </realm>
    ```

---

8. **DataSource configuration** is arguably a toss-up between either version, depending on an organization's goals. Lariat's code has been structured for portability and is decoupled from any specific database:

    ``` xml
    <dataSource id="jdbc/ModernDS" jndiName="jdbc/ModernDS">
        <jdbcDriver libraryRef="jdbcLib" />
        <connectionManager maxPoolSize="50" />
    </dataSource>
    ```

    </br>
    WCA's recommendation utilizes an IBM Db2-specific set of JDBC drivers. For clients with a highly-regulated, Db2-heavy enterprise environment, this code recommendation has much more utility to the requirements of their business:

    ``` xml
    <dataSource jndiName="jdbc/LegacyDS" id="DefaultDataSource">
        <jdbcDriver libraryRef="XADatabase"/>
        <properties.db2.jcc ... />
    </dataSource>
    ```

---

## **v. Next steps**

In the following module, participants will examine how to modernize legacy WebSphere Application Server code for configuration and dependency management.
