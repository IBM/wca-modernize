# **Objectives and requirements**</br>*Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty*

## **i. About this lab**

!!! quote "SECTION I. TERMINOLOGY"
    For readability, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-application-server" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Application Server**</a> (WAS) in this chapter is referred to in shorthand as "WebSphere", unless noted otherwise. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-applications/liberty" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Liberty**</a> is referenced in shorthand as simply "Liberty".

</br>
The approach taken with each module of **Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty**,  engaging with IBM watsonx Code Assistant's (WCA) Chat functionality in the chapters ahead, is to emulate the experience of collaborating with a trusted colleague on how to best take on the modernization of WebSphere Application Server code: segmented by specific use cases, tackling particular business functions that need to be revitalized for cloud-native, and exploring precise pain points within a client's code base. The WCA Chat experience reflects how you and that trusted colleague might, together, approach a scenario like modernizing usage of Enterprise JavaBeans with WebSphere Liberty, as an example.

Thinking about modernization in discrete scenarios such as these, where the aperture is narrowly focused on a specific piece of functionality or use case— rather than trying to modernize an entire, complex application stack altogether —has immense value. It is far more akin and practical to the real-world scenarios that *you* will encounter during engagements with clients: as a seller; a business partner; a trusted advisor. Entrusted with bestowing best practices for how that client can modernize specific pain points in their application code; *not* taking on the task of modernizing the *entirety* of their application stack "in one go."

Crafting complex modernization plans for enterprise-scale applications cannot be approached as explicit "A, then B, followed by C" rulebooks or rigid decision trees. It is essential that you understand how to approach modernization as a collaborative, problem-solving oriented, question-and-answer refinement exercise. WCA Chat, which you will use to these ends in the following modules, is an ideal mechanism for refining the correct modernization approach.

## **ii. Prerequisites**

This lab requires that participants have previously completed the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/1/" target="_blank">**IBM Cloud (SaaS) Configuration**</a> lab in its entirety. Those conducting the hands-on sections of this lab will require access to a deployed instance of WCA Standard Plan and have successfully integrated with the WCA service via either the **Visual Studio Code** (**VS Code**) extension or **Eclipse IDE** plug-ins.

## **iii. Hands-on topics**

For each module of the *Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty* lab, participants will have the opportunity to dissect the contents and purpose of legacy **WebSphere Application Server** (**WAS**) code, examine its limitations in the context of more up-to-date alternatives, and then compare that to a best-practices implementation of that equivalent codebase written in **WebSphere Liberty**.

Afterwards, participants will go hands-on with the **IBM watsonx Code Assistant** (**WCA**) Standard environment to reproduce the steps of modernizing the WAS legacy code into Liberty code. Differences in the two code bases and the benefits of WCA's approach to code modernization will also be examined.

| MODERNIZATION TASK | WEBSPHERE APPLICATION | LIBERTY APPLICATION |
| - | - | - |
| <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/appmod/2/" target="_blank">**Basic migration capabilities**</a> | **WebSphere Enterprise Archive (EAR)** configuration, at enterprise scale, becomes cumbersome to maintain and can often result in frequent deployment delays (or human-induced configuration errors) each time the modules need to be modified. | **Liberty Web Archive (WAR)** configurations remove the need for multiple external descriptors and consolidate settings into a single, unified file. |
| <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/appmod/3/" target="_blank">**Configuration and dependency management**</a> | **WebSphere class loader configuration** implementation suffers from significant (and unnecessary) complexity owing to bloated class-loader configurations. | **Liberty server configuration** is expected to manage dependencies and simplify the overall process of application configuration. |
| <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/appmod/4/" target="_blank">**APIs and libraries**</a> | **WebSphere Scheduler APIs** may not be immediately portable in their current form, they are potentially more costly to maintain than Liberty counterparts, and have less functionality due to outdated implementations. | **Liberty's Jakarta EE-templated APIs** are more transferable across vendors and platforms, are built to cloud-native architecture by design, and are portable to containers. |
| <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/appmod/5/" target="_blank">**Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) modernization**</a> | **WebSphere EJB with XML** represent server-side components used by Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE or Jakarta EE) to encapsulate repeatable business logic. They are more challenging to maintain and prone to human-induced errors. | **Liberty EJBs with annotations** use Java instead of XML, applying them directly within Java classes for configuration. In many cases, this reduces the need for external XML files and eases maintainability. |
| <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/appmod/6/" target="_blank">**Java Message Service integration**</a> | **WebSphere's MQ JMS integration** uses complex configurations made up of verbose XML or admin console requirements. They can be difficult to maintain due to their dispersed nature. | **Liberty's MQ JMS integration** provides a more centralized pattern to simplify the process of troubleshooting messaging integrations and maintaining existing policies. |
| <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/appmod/7/" target="_blank">**Security modernization**</a> | **WebSphere's XML-based security** is challenging to understand and maintain due to XML file separation from the supporting Java code, which tends to lower developer productivity due to frequent context-switching. | **Liberty's annotation-based security** reduces the need for external configuration and instead centralizes security declarations closer to the actual code implementation. |

## **iv. Troubleshooting**

If you require assistance or run into issues with the hands-on lab, help is available.

- **Environment issues:** The lab environment is managed by IBM Technology Zone. <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/help" target="_blank">**Opening a support case ticket**</a> is recommended for issues related to the hands-on environment (provisioning, running, and so on.)

- **Product questions:** For questions related to IBM watsonx Code Assistant capabilities, sales opportunities, roadmap, and other such matters, open a thread on the <a href="https://ibm.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C059NKPUCP9" target="_blank">**#watsonx-code-assistant**</a> Slack channel.

## **v. Next steps**

In the following section, participants will explore fundamental modernization and migration techniques using legacy *WebSphere Enterprise Archive* (*EAR*) configuration code — ultimately producing a modernized *Liberty Web Archive* (*WAR*) configuration codebase.
