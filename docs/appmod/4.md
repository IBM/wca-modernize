# **APIs and libraries**</br>*Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty*
    
## **i. Incentives to modernize**

!!! quote "SECTION I. TERMINOLOGY"
    For readability, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-application-server" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Application Server**</a> (WAS) in this chapter is referred to in shorthand as "WebSphere", unless noted otherwise. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-applications/liberty" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Liberty**</a> is referenced in shorthand as simply "Liberty".

Lariat Corporation's application stack utilizes a myriad of **WebSphere Application Server APIs**— Work Manager API, Async Beans, Scheduler API, and so on —which will likely be impacted and require remediation as part of the company's overall modernization towards WebSphere Liberty. WAS APIs may not be immediately portable in their current form, they are potentially more costly to maintain than their Liberty counterparts, and may have less functionality given their outdated implementations.

Liberty-compatible APIs increase the portability of applications across different Java Enterprise Edition (*Java EE* or *Jakarta EE*) application servers. The result is that developers can more easily facilitate cloud deployments or migrations to other runtimes. Liberty APIs follow standardized annotations and conventions that simplify the boilerplate code needed for applications to exchange data with these APIs. WAS-specific APIs, by contrast, are potentially locked to specific versions of WebSphere - which in turn "lock in" the applications dependent on such APIs.

</br>

| Feature | WebSphere Scheduler API | Liberty's Jakarta EE-templated APIs |
| - | - | - |
| **Standardization** | Built on proprietary WebSphere-only APIs. | Built on industry-standardized Jakarta EE APIs. More transferable across vendors and platforms. |
| **Cloud-Readiness** | Tied to traditional WebSphere Application Server only. | Cloud-native architecture by design and portable to containers. |
| **Developer Productivity** | Complex setup requiring use of admin console and external XML definitions. | Declarative and code-driven with Java annotations. |

Currently, Lariat's **WebSphere Scheduler APIs** rely upon IBM-specific extensions (such as `.com.ibm.websphere` packages) that will need to be identified and remediated before modernization with **Liberty's Jakarta EE-templated APIs**.

The shift from proprietary WAS-based APIs to standardized Liberty-based APIs (built to Jakarta EE / Java EE specifications) should improve application portability and align with industry best practices.

## **ii. WebSphere legacy code**

First, examine the legacy Java code (below), which as mentioned previously is a snapshot of a larger application using **WebSphere Scheduler API**:

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` java linenums="1"
    import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.TaskHandler;
    import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Scheduler;
    import javax.naming.InitialContext;

    public class LegacySchedulerTask {
        public void scheduleTask() throws Exception {
            InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
            Scheduler scheduler = (Scheduler) ctx.lookup("scheduler/legacyScheduler");

            TaskHandler handler = scheduler.createTaskHandler(
                "TaskName",
                new LegacyTask(),
                null,
                "0 0/5 * * * ?",
                true,
                null
            );

            handler.start();
        }
    }
    ```

</br>
The `LegacySchedulerTask` API describes a WAS-specific scheduler (identifiable by the `com.ibm.websphere.scheduler` import statements on **lines 1 and 2**), which invokes IBM-proprietary API standards. These API invocations are in turn used to schedule periodic task executions within Lariat's application estate.

``` java
import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.TaskHandler;
import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Scheduler;
```

Utilizing WAS-specific API calls requires explicit JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) look-ups. Furthermore, it demands manual intervention on the part of application developers to create and manage scheduled API tasks. The result is that this legacy API code, by placing heavy reliance upon WebSphere platform-specific APIs, has impaired the portability of applications.

---

## **iii. Liberty modernized code**

Consider below the modernized (but functionally equivalent) Java code in support of **Liberty's Jakarta EE-templated APIs**:

=== "WEBSPHERE LIBERTY"

    ``` java linenums="1"
    import javax.annotation.Resource;
    import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
    import javax.enterprise.concurrent.ManagedScheduledExecutorService;
    import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

    @ApplicationScoped
    public class ModernSchedulerTask {

        @Resource
        ManagedScheduledExecutorService executor;

        public void scheduleTask() {
            executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(
                () -> {
                    // Modern task logic here
                    System.out.println("Executing scheduled task.");
                },
                0,
                5,
                TimeUnit.MINUTES
            );
        }
    }
    ```

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` java linenums="1"
    import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.TaskHandler;
    import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Scheduler;
    import javax.naming.InitialContext;

    public class LegacySchedulerTask {
        public void scheduleTask() throws Exception {
            InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
            Scheduler scheduler = (Scheduler) ctx.lookup("scheduler/legacyScheduler");

            TaskHandler handler = scheduler.createTaskHandler(
                "TaskName",
                new LegacyTask(),
                null,
                "0 0/5 * * * ?",
                true,
                null
            );

            handler.start();
        }
    }
    ```

</br>
In contrast to the legacy WAS-based Java API, the modernized Liberty approach (templated using Jakarta EE's API conventions) significantly simplifies the scheduling logic. The standardized `ManagedScheduledExecutorService` API for concurrency simplifies the scheduling of tasks using direct resource injection, as indicated by `@Resource` beginning on **line 9**.

``` java
@Resource
ManagedScheduledExecutorService executor;
```

The previous (legacy) requirement of forcing JNDI look-ups, therefore, has been remediated through the use of direct resource injection. The Jakarta EE standard also follows an annotation-driven model for scheduling tasks to reduce the overall complexity of the code and improve its "readability" for human developers.

Ultimately, the modernization efforts have significantly increased the portability and extensibility of Lariat's API-driven application estate. The structure of the API code has been simplified and made much more portable by breaking away from propriety API standards.

## **iv. Hands-on with WCA**

!!! quote "SECTION IV. TERMINOLOGY"
    For the purposes of comparison and brevity, the WCA-generated Liberty code will be referred to simply as "**WCA**" and Lariat Corporation's best-practice modernized code will be referred to as "**Lariat**".

In the following section, participants will have the opportunity to experiment with the **watsonx Code Assistant** (**WCA**) service set up in the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/1/" target="_blank">**IBM Cloud (SaaS) Configuration module**</a>.

- Using the **Chat** feature, which can be accessed via the WCA extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will first ask WCA convert the original *WebSphere Application Service (WCA)* code into a modernized equivalent for *WebSphere Liberty*.
- The lab guide documentation will then walk you through an analysis of the WCA-generated Liberty code and compare that to the best-practice Liberty code discussed previously in **iii. Liberty modernized code**.
- After comparing the two approaches to Liberty modernization, you will have the opportunity to continue tinkering with the WCA Chat service. Experimentation is encouraged. Try influencing WCA's generative AI recommendations by making further prompts or inquiries into the code responses it generates.

When satisfied, you may proceed onwards to the next module.

---

1. **Log in** to the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/3/#iii-install-the-extension" target="_blank">**WCA extension with VS Code**</a>. Once authenticated, proceed to Step 2.

---

2. From the left taskbar, ensure that **watsonx Code Assistant**^[A]^ extension is selected.

    Within the **Chat Session** window, **click** on the `Enter / for commands` prompt^[B]^ as shown.

    </br>
    ![](_attachments/appmod-2.2.png)

---

3. Prime the service to be ready to intake legacy WAS code and modernize that into Liberty code. As a suggestion, **copy** the following prompt, **paste** it into the chat window, and hit ++return++ to execute the modernization request:

    ```
    I need to modernize code written for WebSphere Application Server into WebSphere Liberty. Can you help?
    ```
    !!! warning ""
        **TIP:** You can increase the width of the Chat Session window by clicking and dragging the right-side of the window frame and pulling it towards the right of the screen.

---

4. Now that WCA is primed to receive WAS code, **copy and paste** the following code block into the **Chat Session**, then ++return++ to execute.

    === "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

        ``` java linenums="1"
        import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.TaskHandler;
        import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Scheduler;
        import javax.naming.InitialContext;

        public class LegacySchedulerTask {
            public void scheduleTask() throws Exception {
                InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
                Scheduler scheduler = (Scheduler) ctx.lookup("scheduler/legacyScheduler");

                TaskHandler handler = scheduler.createTaskHandler(
                    "TaskName",
                    new LegacyTask(),
                    null,
                    "0 0/5 * * * ?",
                    true,
                    null
                );

                handler.start();
            }
        }
        ```

---

5. After a few moments, WCA will return a combination of code blocks and explanations to the Chat session console. Cycle through the tab(s) below to examine the **modernized, WCA-generated Liberty code**.

    === "WCA LIBERTY `server.xml` Part 1"

        ``` java linenums="1"
        // Enable the Scheduler feature: 
        // In your server.xml file, add the scheduler-1.0 feature to the featureManager section.
        <featureManager>
            <feature>jsp-2.3</feature>
            <feature>servlet-3.1</feature>
            <feature>scheduler-1.0</feature>
        </featureManager>
        ```

    === "WCA LIBERTY `server.xml` Part 2"

        ``` java linenums="1"
        // Update the task class:
        // Create a new class that implements the com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Task interface.

        import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Task;
        import javax.naming.InitialContext;
        import javax.naming.NamingException;

        public class LegacyTask implements Task {
            private static final String TASK_NAME = "TaskName";
            private static final String CRON_EXPRESSION = "0 0/5 * * * ?";

            @Override
            public void execute() throws Exception {
                // Your task logic here
            }

            @Override
            public String getName() {
                return TASK_NAME;
            }

            @Override
            public String getCronExpression() {
                return CRON_EXPRESSION;
            }
        }
        ```

    === "WCA LIBERTY `server.xml` Part 3"

        ``` java linenums="1"
        // Update the scheduler configuration:
        // In your server.xml file, add a scheduler element to configure the scheduler.
        <scheduler id="legacyScheduler">
        <property name="cronExpression" value="0 0/5 * * * ?"/>
        <property name="initialDelay" value="0"/>
        <property name="period" value="0"/>
        <property name="timeZone" value="UTC"/>
        </scheduler>
        Update the task scheduling code: Modify the 
        scheduleTask
        method to use the Liberty Scheduler API.


        // Update the task scheduling code:
        // Modify the scheduleTask method to use the Liberty Scheduler API.
        import com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Scheduler;
        import javax.naming.InitialContext;
        import javax.naming.NamingException;

        public class LegacySchedulerTask {
            public void scheduleTask() throws Exception {
                InitialContext ctx = new InitialContext();
                Scheduler scheduler = (Scheduler) ctx.lookup("scheduler/legacyScheduler");
                scheduler.schedule(new LegacyTask(), null);
            }
        }
        ```

6. The first thing to note is that Lariat and WCA have taken two fundamentally different **scheduling approaches** on their respective WebSphere Liberty codebases.

    In the case of Lariat, the team implemented the standardized Jakarta EE API with the intent of keeping the code as portable as possible:

    </br>
    ``` java
    @Resource
    ManagedScheduledExecutorService executor;
    ```

    </br>
    WCA recommended the use of `com.ibm.websphere.scheduler.Scheduler` and `Task` interfaces, which require a CRON expression in the XML descriptor and additional code lookups for *Scheduler*:

    </br>
    ``` xml
    <scheduler id="legacyScheduler">
    <property name="cronExpression" value="0 0/5 * * * ?"/>
    <property name="initialDelay" value="0"/>
    <property name="period" value="0"/>
    <property name="timeZone" value="UTC"/>
    </scheduler>
    ```

    </br>
    The WCA solution is arguably stronger in scenarios where complex scheduling tasks are anticipated, given the granularity of control that CRON offers with regular expression matching. The Lariat solution is simpler, but limited in terms of customizability.

---

7. In terms of **portability** of the Liberty codebase, Lariat's implementation has been designed around *Jakarta EE*'s API which provides simple mobility across nearly every Java EE-compliant runtime.

    WCA's recommendation to use the *Scheduler* API (a proprietary Liberty) format ensures full compatibility with WebSphere Liberty endpoints — which, as you will recall, the request to WCA was explicitly to modernize to *Liberty*. But the use of *Scheduler* also poses a potential lock-in risk for that particular distribution, to the exclusion of others.

## **v. Next steps**

In the following module, participants will examine how to modernize legacy WebSphere Application Server code for Enterprise JavaBeans.
