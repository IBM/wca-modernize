# **Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) modernization**</br>*Application Modernization - WebSphere to Liberty*
    
## **i. Incentives to modernize**

!!! quote "SECTION I. TERMINOLOGY"
    For readability, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/websphere-application-server" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Application Server**</a> (WAS) in this chapter is referred to in shorthand as "WebSphere", unless noted otherwise. Similarly, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/cloud-pak-for-applications/liberty" target="_blank">**IBM WebSphere Liberty**</a> is referenced in shorthand as simply "Liberty".

WebSphere **Enterprise JavaBeans** (**EJB**) represent server-side components used by Java Enterprise Edition (*Java EE* or *Jakarta EE*) to encapsulate repeatable business logic. In turn, EJB can be used to provide scalable and highly performant handling for requests made by Lariat Corporation's web application estate. EJBs provide the resource access management for the databases, messaging services, and external APIs these such application require to power their business functions. WebSphere's EJBs make extensive use of *XML* deployment descriptors to configure their behavior.

**Liberty EJBs** use Java *annotations* instead of *XML*, applying them directly within Java classes for configuration. In many cases, this eliminates the need for external XML files completely (or at least significantly reduces their size and number).

</br>

| Feature | WebSphere EJB with XML | Liberty EJB with annotations |
| - | - | - |
| **Maintainability** | Difficult due to scattered XML configs. | Improved due to cohesive annotations. |
| **Readability** | Lower due to switching between Java and XML. | Higher due to configuration directly in Java code. |
| **Productivity** | Lower due to manual XML edits. | Higher due to rapid development through annotations. |
| **Error Propensity** | Higher chance of manual XML errors. | Lower due to clear annotations and IDE checks. |

Modernizing WebSphere's EJB's stateless session beans into **Liberty's standard-compliant EJB** will provide Lariat with the net benefit of code that's easier to maintain, more portable, and extensible for modern cloud-native endpoints. Ultimately, this should yield a simplified developer experience and better resource management.

## **ii. WebSphere legacy code**

First, examine the legacy code (below), which as mentioned previously is a snapshot of a larger application using **WebSphere's EJB Stateful Session Bean with XML**:

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1"
    <!-- ejb-jar.xml -->
    <ejb-jar>
        <enterprise-beans>
            <session>
                <ejb-name>LegacySessionBean</ejb-name>
                <home>com.lariat.ejb.LegacyHome</home>
                <remote>com.lariat.ejb.LegacyRemote</remote>
                <ejb-class>com.lariat.ejb.LegacySessionBean</ejb-class>
                <session-type>Stateless</session-type>
                <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>
            </session>
        </enterprise-beans>
    </ejb-jar>
    ```

</br>

The legacy EJB implementation uses XML (`ejb-jar.xml` beginning on **line 1**) to explicitly define the contents of the *stateful* session bean. This requires that the `<home>` and `<remote>` interfaces be explicitly defined, along with the bean class. Transaction types and security are also configured *externally* via descriptors within the XML.

---

## **iii. Liberty modernized code**

Consider below the modernized (but functionally equivalent) application code using **Liberty's EJB Stateless Session Bean with annotations**:

=== "WEBSPHERE LIBERTY"

    ``` java linenums="1"
    package com.lariat.ejb;

    import javax.ejb.Stateless;
    import javax.ejb.Remote;

    @Stateless
    @Remote(ModernRemote.class)
    public class ModernSessionBean implements ModernRemote {

        @Override
        public String getGreeting(String name) {
            return "Hello, " + name + "!";
        }
    }

    package com.lariat.ejb;

    import javax.ejb.Remote;

    @Remote
    public interface ModernRemote {
        String getGreeting(String name);
    }
    ```

=== "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

    ``` xml linenums="1"
    <!-- ejb-jar.xml -->
    <ejb-jar>
        <enterprise-beans>
            <session>
                <ejb-name>LegacySessionBean</ejb-name>
                <home>com.lariat.ejb.LegacyHome</home>
                <remote>com.lariat.ejb.LegacyRemote</remote>
                <ejb-class>com.lariat.ejb.LegacySessionBean</ejb-class>
                <session-type>Stateless</session-type>
                <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>
            </session>
        </enterprise-beans>
    </ejb-jar>
    ```

</br>

The modernized Liberty code adopts EJB with Java annotations directly within the bean implementation; for example, utilizing such annotations as `@Stateless` beginning on **line 6**:

``` java
@Stateless
@Remote(ModernRemote.class)
public class ModernSessionBean implements ModernRemote {

    @Override
    public String getGreeting(String name) {
        return "Hello, " + name + "!";
    }
}
```

</br> 

This approach also eliminates the need for explicit home interfaces, instead allowing Lariat's developers to directly specify remote interfaces within the bean definition. There are also positive side effects to the "readability" of the code â€” since transaction management and security settings are managed via annotations, the amount of XML overhead is reduced and thus the code can be more easily parsed (and maintained) by humans.

Ultimately, Liberty's modernized EJB implementation simplifies the bean declaration significantly and reduces the amount of boilerplate code necessary for the application. In turn, Lariat's code will be easier to maintain, more readable for their developers, and easier to extend with capabilities over time.

## **iv. Hands-on with WCA**

!!! quote "SECTION IV. TERMINOLOGY"
    For the purposes of comparison and brevity, the WCA-generated Liberty code will be referred to simply as "**WCA**" and Lariat Corporation's best-practice modernized code will be referred to as "**Lariat**".
    
In the following section, participants will have the opportunity to experiment with the **watsonx Code Assistant** (**WCA**) service set up in the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/1/" target="_blank">**IBM Cloud (SaaS) Configuration module**</a>.

- Using the **Chat** feature, which can be accessed via the WCA extension for Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you will first ask WCA convert the original *WebSphere Application Service (WCA)* code into a modernized equivalent for *WebSphere Liberty*.
- The lab guide documentation will then walk you through an analysis of the WCA-generated Liberty code and compare that to the best-practice Liberty code discussed previously in **iii. Liberty modernized code**.
- After comparing the two approaches to Liberty modernization, you will have the opportunity to continue tinkering with the WCA Chat service. Experimentation is encouraged. Try influencing WCA's generative AI recommendations by making further prompts or inquiries into the code responses it generates.

When satisfied, you may proceed onwards to the next module.

---

1. **Log in** to the <a href="https://ibm.github.io/wca-l4/saas/3/#iii-install-the-extension" target="_blank">**WCA extension with VS Code**</a>. Once authenticated, proceed to Step 2.

---

2. From the left taskbar, ensure that **watsonx Code Assistant**^[A]^ extension is selected.

    Within the **Chat Session** window, **click** on the `Enter / for commands` prompt^[B]^ as shown.

    </br>

---

3. Prime the service to be ready to intake legacy WAS code and modernize that into Liberty code. As a suggestion, **copy** the following prompt, **paste** it into the chat window, and hit ++return++ to execute the modernization request:

    ```
    I need to modernize code written for WebSphere Application Server into WebSphere Liberty. Can you help?
    ```
    !!! warning ""
        **TIP:** You can increase the width of the Chat Session window by clicking and dragging the right-side of the window frame and pulling it towards the right of the screen.

---

4. Now that WCA is primed to receive WAS code, **copy and paste** the following code block into the **Chat Session**, then ++return++ to execute.

    === "WEBSPHERE APPLICATION SERVER"

        ``` xml linenums="1"
        <!-- ejb-jar.xml -->
        <ejb-jar>
            <enterprise-beans>
                <session>
                    <ejb-name>LegacySessionBean</ejb-name>
                    <home>com.lariat.ejb.LegacyHome</home>
                    <remote>com.lariat.ejb.LegacyRemote</remote>
                    <ejb-class>com.lariat.ejb.LegacySessionBean</ejb-class>
                    <session-type>Stateless</session-type>
                    <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>
                </session>
            </enterprise-beans>
        </ejb-jar>
        ```

---

5. After a few moments, WCA will return a combination of code blocks and explanations to the Chat session console. Cycle through the tab(s) below to examine the **modernized, WCA-generated Liberty code**.

    === "WCA LIBERTY `ejb-jar.xml` Part 1"

        ``` xml linenums="1"
        <ejb-jar xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee"
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/ejb-jar_3_1.xsd"
        version="3.1">

            <enterprise-beans>

                <session>

                    <ejb-name>LegacySessionBean</ejb-name>

                    <ejb-class>com.lariat.ejb.LegacySessionBean</ejb-class>

                    <session-type>Stateless</session-type>

                    <transaction-type>Container</transaction-type>

                    <concurrency-strategy>OnePerRequest</concurrency-strategy>

                    <resource-ref>

                        <res-ref-name>jdbc/LegacyDS</res-ref-name>

                        <res-type>javax.sql.DataSource</res-type>

                        <res-auth>Container</res-auth>

                </resource-ref>

                </session>

            </enterprise-beans>

        </ejb-jar>
        ```

    === "WCA LIBERTY `ejb-jar.xml` Part 2"

        ``` java linenums="1"
        import javax.annotation.Resource;
        import javax.ejb.Stateless;
        import javax.sql.DataSource;

        @Stateless
        public class LegacySessionBean {
            @Resource(name = "jdbc/LegacyDS")
            private DataSource dataSource;

            // Your EJB methods here
        }
        ```

---

6. In terms of **EJB declarations**, there is a divergence between the approaches taken by Lariat and favored by WCA.

    </br>
    ``` java 
    @Stateless
    @Remote(ModernRemote.class)
    public class ModernSessionBean implements ModernRemote
    ```

    In the case of the Lariat code (above), the declaration is fully annotation-based â€” as discussed earlier in this section. This provides a clear contract between the interface and applications, and is a relatively simple pattern for Lariat's developers to build against. 

    </br>
    ``` xml
    <session>
        <ejb-name>LegacySessionBean</ejb-name>
        <ejb-class>com.lariat.ejb.LegacySessionBean</ejb-class>
        <session-type>Stateless</session-type>
    ...
    </session>
    ```

    </br>
    WCA recommends that the EJB metadata remain in XML format, without the use of `@Remote` or `@Local` interfaces that were present within the Lariat code. Instead, WCA relies on container parsing of the `ejb-jar.xml` definition and generating it based on that discovered class.

---

7. With respect to **resource injections**, this pattern is absent from the Lariat codebase. By contrast, WCA has configured the injection of a `DataSource` via `@Resource` in both Java and `ejb-jar.xml`. For example:

    </br>
    ``` java
    @Resource(name = "jdbc/LegacyDS")
    private DataSource dataSource;
    ```

    </br>
    One consideration to keep in mind with this case is that WCA's approach is tailored specifically for dealing with older enterprise systems or in cases where applications need to override behaviors per environment (via resource injection).
