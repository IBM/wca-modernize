# **Objectives and requirements**</br>*IBM Cloud (SaaS) Configuration*

## **i. About this lab**

!!! warning "OPTIONAL MATERIAL"
    The following modules have been prepared for those who would like to replicate the configuration of a WCA environment on their local machines. These configuration steps will enable participants to authorize VS Code or Eclipse IDEs for use with *IBM watsonx Code Assistant* via extensions (or plug-ins), bypassing the need of working through a virtual machine. Instructions are available for doing so on both macOS and Windows operating system-based machines.

    The contents of this chapter are **not** included within the final evaluation test.

</br>
There are two tiers of plans (editions) available for Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) deployments of **IBM watsonx Code Assistant** (WCA):

| Plan | Details | Use Cases |
| - | - | - |
| **ESSENTIALS PLAN** | Accelerates software development, allowing developers to use WCA with integrated generative AI (gen AI) for coding. | Generating, explaining, and documenting code. Creation of unit tests. |
| **STANDARD PLAN** | In addition to all the capabilities found in the *Essentials* plan, the *Standard* plan includes enterprise Java modernization capabilities. | Java upgrades, regardless of runtime. WebSphere to Liberty transformation. Enhanced unit test generation and code explanation. |

!!! note ""
    To ensure that participants have access to the enterprise Java modernization capabilities, the instructions of this module assume that the participant has access to a **WCA Standard Plan** license (and API key) as the basis of the SaaS environment.

## **ii. Prerequisites and WCA setup**

There are two high-level architectural components to a WCA Standard Plan:

1. **WCA extension**: The interface through which developers interact with WCA, in the form of an extension (sometimes called a "plug-in") running in an integrated development environment (IDE). The IDEs currently supported by WCA are Visual Studio Code (VS Code) and Eclipse.
2. **WCA service:** The back-end WCA service, to which requests from the extension are made and the results returned to the participant's IDE. It is available as software-as-a-service (SaaS) on IBM Cloud and as deployable software for on-premises deployments.

As mentioned previously, it's assumed that those following these instructions already have an entitlement (valid license) to watsonx Code Assistant's Standard (SaaS) plan.

## **iii. Next steps**

In the following section, participants will configure their local machine with the necessary enterprise Java and Maven drivers.
